# Week 5

Tasks
- [X] Compare and contrast various clustering algorithms.
      - Visualizing the output of clustering algorithms on all possible permutations of variable pairs.
      - Interpreting the output of the clustering algorithms.
      

Issues
 
- Affinity Propagation's execution time was too long even while being applied on one pair of variables. Optimized the code to remedy this.

- To facilitate viewing the output for the following clustering algorithms, 
                           1. BIRCH
                           2. DBSCAN
                           3. OPTICS
 separate folders have been created with each html file showing the corresponding graph for each permutation of variable pairs.
