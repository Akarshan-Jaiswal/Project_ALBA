## Initial Project Proposal

> The AIM of this project is to help in reducing the overall deprivation in Scotland
> by analyzing the SIMD(Scottish Index of Multiple Deprivation) for Multiple years
> and help in prevention/dispatch of emergency services in the most deprived regions.

### Research objectives

> [!NOTE]
> What are the questions you are trying to answer? What are the goals of your project?

### Milestones

> [!NOTE]
> Create a bullet list of the key milestones for your project. Discuss these with your group. You may need to update these as the project progresses.
